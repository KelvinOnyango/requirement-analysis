# -Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository documents the process of requirement analysis in software projects. It documents how to properly gather, analyze, and document software requirements in order to deliver successfull projects.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified software product. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where business requirements are translated into detailed technical specifications.

During requirement analysis, stakeholders collaborate to:
- Identify the problem to be solved
- Define the system's functional and non-functional needs
- Establish constraints and assumptions
- Create models and prototypes when necessary

This phase helps ensure that the final product meets business objectives and user needs while minimizing costly changes during later development stages.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Reduces Project Risks**: Proper analysis helps identify potential issues early, preventing costly rework later in development.
2. **Sets Clear Expectations**: Documents exactly what needs to be built, aligning stakeholders and development teams.
3. **Foundation for Design**: Provides the necessary information for architects and developers to create appropriate technical solutions.
4. **Facilitates Accurate Estimation**: Helps project managers create more realistic timelines and budgets.
5. **Improves Quality**: Clear requirements lead to better testing criteria and higher quality end products.
